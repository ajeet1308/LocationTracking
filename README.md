# Create a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment named `venv`, you can use the following command:

```shell
python -m venv env
```

This command will create a new directory named `venv` and set up a virtual environment inside it.

After creating the virtual environment, you can activate it by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:

For macOS and Linux:
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you can install and run your Python code within the virtual environment.
